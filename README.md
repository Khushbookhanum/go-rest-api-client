 Go REST API Client

A simple "REST API Client built in Go (Golang)" that demonstrates how to perform CRUD operations (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`) using Go‚Äôs standard `net/http` package.  
This project interacts with the public [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API ‚Äî a free online REST service used for testing and prototyping.

OVERVIEW:
This project showcases how to:
- Make HTTP requests in Go
- Handle JSON encoding/decoding
- Work with REST API endpoints
- Manage HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
